I've been looking for the rips of the Viki version of this k-drama. Every other version seem to be the same as the KBS or KBS 2 one, which have logos on the corners.<br>
I was able to find episodes 1 to 6 of the clear/logoless/Viki version, but I can't find the other six.<br>

<br>
I would rip them from Viki myself, but the only program that ever worked for me doesn't seem to be compatible anymore and yt-dlp says it's DRM protected.<br>
<br>
So, if you happen to have the Viki version of episodes 6 to 12 or know a way to rip from Viki that currently works, and you're happy to share it, I would be really really grateful !! :]
