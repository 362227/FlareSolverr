<br>
"<b>Old Town Road</b>" is the debut mainstream single by American rapper Lil Nas X, first released independently in December 2018. After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by Columbia Records in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer Billy Ray Cyrus (version of this release), which was released on April 5, 2019. Both were included in Lil Nas X's second EP, <i>7</i> (2019).<br>
<br>
The song has been widely labeled as "country rap", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. The beat was created by a Dutch teenager named Kiowa Roukema, who goes by YoungKio. He uploaded it to a site called BeatStars, where Lil Nas X bought it for $30. It features a sample of "34 Ghosts IV" by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. The sample was placed behind trap-style Roland TR-808 drums and bass. Lil Nas X recorded "Old Town Road" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real-world struggles were an influence on some of the lyrics.<br>
<br>
The song initially gained popularity on the social video sharing app TikTok and eventually entered the <i>Billboard</i> charts in March 2019. It reached number 19 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs chart before the magazine disqualified it from the chart on the grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of country music. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both versions of the song collectively peaked at number one on the general <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, for a record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks and the remix peaked at #50 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart. One or more versions of "Old Town Road" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and have charted in the top 10 in various other markets.<br>
<br>
The song was certified diamond by the RIAA in October 2019 for selling ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be certified diamond. At the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, the remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for Record of the Year and won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Music Video. In October 2019, Nas X's label Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, won the Music &amp; Sound Recordings Award from SAG-AFTRA "for work that exemplifies equal access" of LGBTQ and "other misrepresented or underrepresented groups." In September 2021, the song set the record as the second highest certified song ever by the RIAA with 16-times platinum status in the United States, meaning it accumulated 16 million equivalent song units. It has sold over 18 million records worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. <i>Rolling Stone</i> named it the 490th greatest song of all time in its 2021 list.<br>
<br>
On May 17, the official music video for the remix dropped, with Lil Nas X and Billie Ray Cyrus as Old West outlaws on the run in 1889. Billed as a "movie," it runs 5:08, starting with a horseback chase scene where the town sheriff, played by Chris Rock, is after the pair. Rock calls it off, telling his deputies, "When you see a black man on a horse going that fast, you just gotta let him fly." But there's more trouble ahead for the outlaws, especially for Lil Nas X, who escapes gunfire by jumping into a bunker that turns into a wormhole, transporting him to modern-day Old Town Road, where he's out of place with his cowboy gear and horse. The locals warm up to him though, and he earns their respect when he wins a drag race with his horse. Later on, Lil Nas meets up again with Cyrus, and together they turn a bingo night at the town hall (led by rapper Rico Nasty) into a line-dancing-filled party. Diplo backs them up by strumming on a washboard as the senior citizens take to the dance floor. Other cameos include rappers Vince Staples, HaHa Davis and Jozzy as well as "Old Town Road" beatmaker YoungKio. It was made by the director Calmatic, whose work includes "Young, Dumb and Broke" for Khalid and "Bubblin'" for Anderson Paak.<br>
