A short story about this video <img src="styles/default/xenforo/smilies/grimace-48.png" class="mceSmilie" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p"><br>
i Am So happy right now i literally can't control myself!<br>
I have finally found this video that I've been searching for, <br>
for 3 years, 3 years of hoping <img src="styles/default/xenforo/smilies/unhappy-48.png" class="mceSmilie" alt=":(" title="Frown    :("><br>
You have no idea how personal this situation was to me.<br>
Years ago,had a flash drive with my favorite music videos in it because i didn't have a personal computer to archive my stuff;<br>
Times were pretty rough those days and my mental health became to decline very bad due to some things i had to go through;<br>
I went to a mental hospital for couple of weeks and i went through 12 session of ECT or Electroconvulsive therapy.<br>
One of the major side effect of this procedure is memory loss and i lost a part of my memory that i haven't been able to recover after last 10 years and forgetting about many song names and lyrics was part of it.<br>
Long story short, I lost my flash drive and i lost my memory and this song was forgotten for ever.<br>
I've been trying to find it for years and yesterday, against all odds i finally found it!<br>
Gosh I'm happy right now <img src="styles/default/xenforo/smilies/big_smile-48.png" class="mceSmilie" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)">))<br>
It's a cool song you should check it out<br>
Also look at this thread I posted it 3 years ago, lol<br>
