"<b>Fields of Gold</b>" is a song written and performed by English rock musician Sting. It first appeared on his fourth studio album, <i>Ten Summoner's Tales</i> (1993). The song was released as a single on 7 June 1993, reaching No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 23 on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The song also reached No. 2 in Canada and No. 6 in Iceland. In 1994, it was awarded one of BMI's Pop Songs Awards.<br>
<br>
This song is about feeling joyous, but knowing that the joy is going to end someday. Sting wrote it after he bought a house near a barley field. The sunsets and the colors of the field were an inspiration for the lyrics, along with his love at the time, Trudie Styler, whom he married in 1992. Styler has said that the song is one of her favorites.<br>
The major theme in this song is commitment. It is about a man who has broken promises before, but is determined make this relationship last.<br>
<br>
"Fields of Gold" and all the other tracks on the album were recorded at Lake House, Wiltshire, mixed at The Townhouse Studio, London, England and mastered at Masterdisk, New York City. The cover of the single was photographed at Wardour Old Castle in Wiltshire, as was the cover for the album <i>Ten Summoner's Tales</i>.<br>
<br>
The music video of this release is ripped from the DVD release of <i>Ten Summoner's Tales</i>.<br>
The 'Ten Summoner's Tales' video was filmed in Sting's 400 year old Wiltshire home, Lake House, at the time of recording the album. This was his first venture as a video album and the release won a Grammy award in 1994 for "Best Long Form Video Of The Year".<br>
